## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
For this project, I was interestested in using Udacity data regarding women's clothing retailer.
"StyleSense", a rapidly growing online women's clothing retailer, is known for its trendy and affordable fashion, and its customer base has exploded in recent months. 
This influx of new customers is fantastic for business, but it has created a challenge: a backlog of product reviews with missing data. 
Customers are still leaving valuable feedback in the text of their reviews, but they aren't always indicating whether they recommend the product.

This model will analyze the text of a review, the customer's age, the product category, and other relevant information to predict whether or not the customer would recommend the product.
